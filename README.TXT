VULCAN.io is a web-based application designed to assess and report vulnerabilities in the security headers of websites. The application analyzes specific HTTP headers to ensure compliance with security best practices. By inputting a URL, users can receive a detailed report on the presence and configuration of critical security 

Project Description
VULCAN.io provides a simple, user-friendly interface for analyzing the security headers of websites. The tool helps identify potential vulnerabilities by examining HTTP headers and advising on security improvements.

Project Goals
•	Security Awareness: Increase awareness about the importance of security headers.
•	Accessibility: Provide an easy-to-use platform for website owners and developers to check their site's security.
•	Educational Resource: Serve as an educational tool, explaining each security header and its importance.

Features
•	URL Input: Users can input a website URL to analyze.
•	Security Header Analysis: Checks for the presence and correctness of specific security headers.
•	User Interface: Intuitive design with clear results presentation.

Technology Stack
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
•	Backend: Python (Flask or Django)

Security Headers Analyzed
•	Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): Ensures secure connections.
•	X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME type sniffing.
•	Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Helps prevent XSS and other code injection attacks.
•	X-Frame-Options: Protects against clickjacking.
•	Referrer-Policy: Controls the information sent with referrer headers.
•	Permissions-Policy: Controls access to features like geolocation, camera, microphone, etc.

User Interface
•	Homepage: Simple input form for entering the website URL.
•	Results Page: Displays the analysis results, including:
	Header status (Present/Missing)

API Endpoints
•	GET /api/analyze: Accepts a URL parameter and returns the analysis results.
•	POST /api/report: Allows users to submit feedback or request a detailed report.

Deployment
1.	Development Environment: Local setup using Docker or virtual environments.
2.	Production Environment: Deployment on cloud platforms like AWS, with load balancing and scaling capabilities.

Testing and Validation
•	Unit Testing: Test individual components and functions.
•	Integration Testing: Ensure all components work together as expected.
•	User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Validate the application meets user requirements.
•	Security Testing: Check for vulnerabilities in the application itself.
